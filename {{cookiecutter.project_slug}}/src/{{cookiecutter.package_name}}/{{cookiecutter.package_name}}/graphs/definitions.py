"""Pydantic-powered graph primitives for orchestrating workflows.

OPTIONAL: Delete entire graphs/ directory if Ring 0 doesn't need workflow orchestration.
INFRASTRUCTURE: If you keep this, the pattern (Pydantic models, typed dependencies) is standard.

See: src/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}/graphs/README.md for guidance on when to use.
